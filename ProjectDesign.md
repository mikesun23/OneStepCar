Build a better bridge man.

General train thought:

    bidding on a time frame, chess-timer mechanism works only if we have enough flow.
    if we only have hundreds of view per day. the timer will just bug people out.

    question: how we initiate the flow?
        1. there should be some business grow solutions. 
        2. i can start promotion from wechat, by friends? but hell no chinese dealers. 
        3. maybe i can try out some dealers? see if they'd like to put there cars online?

        * I got to find some way to attract fair amount of flow.
        * even make the site for entertaining purpose at first, for example:
            so dealers can list their cars with higher price on my site. and let the user bid on those. 
            just market feedback, users can bid what ever they want, make some fun out of it. let users draw in more users. And attract younger people and enthuiasts. 

    Assumption: we have fair amount of target users on the sites, 
    what will happen? how could you be sure the app will make ppl buy or sell on your sites?
        1. if usrs want sell/buy cars, then they are at the god damn right place. just no medium fees/cost.
        
        * build trust is very important for this kind of non-middle man services. need some design here.
        
        Assumption: we build fairly solid trust with users, so does it mean we can make deals happen?
        1. we have fair amount of users, and they trust each other to make deal with.

        * how good are deals? do you have enough cars to sell? assume both seller and buyer trust you. and each other. they make deal only if they are better than other places. 

        Assumption: we need to filter out all good deals, and make buyer confident. 
        now what? 

        * a facinating transition process. everything should be like a finger snap. 

        Assumption: we have good transaction/transition process. now what? some warranty? auto activity? 

        Definition: man if I want to do this business, i need to be fucking inside of the group and activities. 

Core1: "You, all of you, name prices"
Core2: "No, fucking middle man and cost"
Core3: "Only focus on fun sporty cars" => target user: 

who are buyers, that is the problem, rich people don't give a fuck ,they don't buy used car. 
then normal people can't afford high-end cars?
